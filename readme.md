# AHF KRACH Calculator

This tool was written to reproduce the KRACH rankings as provided by the [AHF (Atlantic Hockey Federation)](https://atlantichockeyfederation.com/).

**[Current AHF Rankings are available here.](results/readme.md)**

For information on KRACH itself, see the [KRACH Overview](docs/krach.md).

For information on the AHFs usage of KRACH, see the [AHF Overview](docs/ahf.md).
